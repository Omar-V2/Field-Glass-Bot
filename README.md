# Field-Glass-Bot
A short python script that automatically fills in fieldglass timesheets
# Usage
After cloning the project, enter your username and password in credentials.py
After, simply run AutoFieldGlass.py and let the script do the rest.
The Script won't actually submit the timesheet for you, this is done intentionally
so that you can make sure everything looks good before submitting yourself.
