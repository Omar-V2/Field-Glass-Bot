# Field-Glass-Bot
A short python script that automatically fills in fieldglass timesheets.
# Usage
After cloning the project, enter your username and password in credentials.py  
After, simply run "python auto_field_glass.py" and let the script do the rest.
The Script won't actually submit the timesheet for you, this is done intentionally
so that you can make sure everything looks good before submitting yourself.
# Usage with Cron Jobs
If you don't know what Cron Jobs are here is a great video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEdHAwHfGPc  
You can set up your system's crontab such that this script is executed automatically on a weekly basis,
for example every Friday at 6pm. This way you don't have to run the script explicilty yourself!
An example crontab file is included in the root directory of this repo for reference.
